# The 1 System

## easy

easy is a architecture-agnostic ANSI C implementation of an LALR parsing table generator.
It compiles a grammar written in text and parses an input stream of tokens, generating a walkable IR as output.

The name is satiric since this is the hardest thing I've written in years.
