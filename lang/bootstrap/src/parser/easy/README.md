# The 1 System

## easy

easy is a C89 implementation of an LALR parsing table generator used in the 1 bootstrap compiler.

It compiles a grammar written in text and parses an input stream of tokens, generating a walkable AST as output.

The name is satiric since this is the hardest thing I've written in years.
