# The 1 System

The biggest expression of my perfectionism.

## The 1 Programming Language
1 is a programming language.
- As easy and fast to write as Python: no boilerplate, extended syntax, sensible iterators
- As fast in runtime as C
- As portable as C89

## Bootstrapping
The bootstrap compiler is in progress of being written. It's progressing fast as of January 2024.

## Status
- [x] Define the basics in my head (over many years)
- [ ] Write the bootstrap compiler [*IN PROGRESS*](bootstrap)
- [ ] Write the compiler
- [ ] Finish bootstrapping
- [ ] Standard library
- [ ] At least document something
